	<h1>Z Notation Issues</h1>
	<p>
		The Shape Expressions 1.0 Definition specification that was published on the W3C website on 2 June 2014 contains Z Notation.
		Unfortunately, errors were introduced when the Z Notation was manually translated from LaTeX to HTML.
		These errors need to be corrected, and the version published on W3C should be updated.
		The specification also contains stylistic issues and semantic errors in the Z Notation, which should also be corrected.
